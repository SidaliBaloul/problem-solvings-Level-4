# c-problem-solvings

This repository contains a collection of C++ problem-solving tasks And 2 Simple projects that I completed a long time ago when I first started learning how to program.
At the time, my focus was on understanding:

Basics of programming

Control flow (loops, conditionals, branching)

Working with functions

Standard input/output

Problem-solving logic

Functional programming style rather than OOP

These exercises reflect early learning and experimentation with the language. They were intentionally not written using object-oriented programming, classes, or advanced C++ features. Instead, the code relies heavily on standalone functions and procedural logic.

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

To document my early programming journey

To show progress from fundamental concepts to more structured problem-solving

To archive small coding tasks, algorithmic exercises, and basic computational problems
